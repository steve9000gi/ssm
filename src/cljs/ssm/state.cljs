  ;; You can run CLJS code in your browser from the open Figwheel session in
  ;; your terminal. Just type some code into the Figwheel console, and when you
  ;; hit return it will compile the code and run it in the attached browser.

  ;; Below are some expressions that are useful for testing. We `assoc` things
  ;; directly into the state, and Om/React running in the browser will
  ;; (assuming our code is good) render it appropriately.

  ;; (Note: this is in a `comment` block for two reasons: (1) it's more
  ;; convenient when we have multiple lines and expressions than using either
  ;; `;` or `#_`, and (2) it's a convention in Clojure-land to have "tests" and
  ;; commonly used development expressions that don't belong in the main code
  ;; in a comment block. Also, with a sufficiently powerful text editor like
  ;; Vim (with vim-fireplace) or Emacs (with Cider), you can execute this code
  ;; directly without having to copy-and-paste into a different terminal
  ;; window.
