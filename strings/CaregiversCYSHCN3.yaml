  'Welcome to the System Support Map Wizard'
welcome-text.paras:
  - 'A System Support Map (SSM) is a way of visualizing the different kinds of support you might use to work on a complicated challenge. Completing SSMs will support your own thinking about your objectives, needs, and resources.'
  - 'Specifically, SSMs walk responding individuals or organizations through the process of documenting their own role in a collaboration: how they are operationalizing that role in terms of specific responsibilities;  It describes what their role entails in terms of responsibilities, what they need to succeed in meeting their responsibilities; specific, resources they rely on (and assessments of how supportive they are);, and their top three wishes to maximize success in their work.: things they don&rsquo;t have that would make their work easier. Additionally, SSMs from parents and caregivers of children and youth with special health care needs can become the foundation for improving care coordination and for aligning efforts to meet families&rsquo;’ needs more efficiently.'
  - 'Check the sidebar for some examples of challenges for which completing system support maps might guide that are relevant to parents and caregivers of children and youth with special health care needs.'
  - 'This wizard will ask you questions and then build the System Support Map for you based on your answers.'
  - 'Thank you for creating a System Support Map.  We hope the process and resulting map is useful.  After completing a map, you will have an opportunity to save and print your map.  We will save your maps in a secure database so that you can access them in the future.  Your maps will also be added to a group of maps that may be aggregated and analyzed together in a research project to learn more about the systems that support Maternal and Child Health in the US and territories.  Your map will be de-identified and will not be linked to you personally in any reports or publications resulting from this study.  Please contact Dr. Kristen Hassmiller Lich at klich@unc.edu if you have any questions about System Support Mapping or about the research project.'

  - 'Here&rsquo;s a quick overview of the process.'
  - 'Notice the rings in the chart below and the labels for each ring. The labels are &ldquo;Role/Identity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Most Important Responsibilities,&rdquo; &ldquo;General Needs for Each Responsibility,&rdquo; &ldquo;Available Resources,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wish List.&rdquo;' 
  - 'You will build your SSM step by step, starting inside the innermost ring and working your way outwards.'
  - 'The wizard is intended to build the SSM for you, but there are some things you can control along the way.  You can zoom in and out of the map by using your mouse&rsquo;s scroll button. You can move the whole map around by holding the left mouse button down anywhere on the background and dragging. You can move shapes around by holding the left mouse button down on the shape you want to move and dragging.  If the arrows that the wizard builds overlap, you can move the shapes and the arrows will move too, though it&rsquo;s best to do this step at the very end because the position of shapes changes whenever a new shape is addedIf one arrow obscures another, you can move the shapes the arrows are attached to and the arrows will move along with them, although it&rsquo;s best to do this rearranging at the very end, when all the shapes and arrows are in place. Once you start the wizard, you can step away and complete the wizard in parts – just keep this browser window open. When your SSM is complete, you will be able to save the map as a special file, which you can open and view or edit further using our web-based System Support Mapping tool. We&rsquo;ll give you instructions on how to do this at the end. You&rsquo;ll also be able to download a picture of your map, which you could easily share with others electronically.'

  - 'Before starting to build your SSM, focus on a specific challenge.  This could be meeting the needs of a family with a child with special health care needs or coordinating care.'
  - 'Please take a few minutes to develop a clear idea of the challenge you are attempting to map and your role in it.'
  - 'This is important! If you don&rsquo;t have a solid understanding of your role in this challenge, this map-building exercise could be unclear and overwhelming.'
  - 'In the text below, please briefly describe the challenge you will focus on in this map.'
  - 'As a last step before we begin your map, provide a little more context around your experiences. In the text box below, please briefly describe your child, including age and any particular healthcare needs, diagnoses, or challenges.'

Some possible roles are: parent, sibling, grandparent, or , caregiver., or care coordinator. Feel free to add as much detail as you would like. You can also describe the health care needs of your child or any other pertinent information for your role'

ring2-aside:
  'Tip: For some people it makes more sense to describe activities, objectives, or goals instead of responsibilities in this ring. As long as you are describing ways you spend your time related to the challenge you are mapping, the specific label does not matter.'

  - 'The second ring contains the responsibilities that you have in your role as <code><span id="wizard_role_text">_</span></code>.'
  - 'Identify the four to eight most important responsibilities related to this role and add them here.  Some examples are included in the drop-down list in the response box. You may choose one of those as your response, or just type something else in.'
  - 'When you click the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button below, the responsibilities you&rsquo;ve entered will be added to the map below. After that you can add other responsibilities, or click the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to go to the next step.'

Be sure to consider personal needs, like patience, empathy, energy, and creativity.  You can be very specific, such as &ldquo;I need access to reliable transportation to attend doctor appointments,&rdquo; or more general, such as &ldquo;I need guidance.&rdquo;'
  - 'You&rsquo;ll be asked about each responsibility in turn, starting with the first one you entered. Again, feel free to choose from the drop-down list, or write in something else. As you add needs, they will be entered into your SSM. At first, the positioning will look odd. Please keep going – it will improve as you add more needs. And, if you want, you can move things around when your map is completely filled in. If you move things now, they will get moved back every time a new item is added.'

  'Tip: Think creatively about resources! If needs were are ingredients in a recipe, resources might include things like a favorite cookbook/recipe, particular brands of an ingredient, or a store that sells many everything you need on your grocery list in one stop, or a friend who makes baking so much more fun!'
ring4-intro.paras:
  - 'The next ring identifies the resources that you use to help you meet your needs described in from Ring #3.' 
  - 'Reflect for a moment about the needs you listed. What specific things, organizations, places, personal strengths, or people have you tried (whether or not they have helped you) to get your needs that need met? Resources for your map might include public transportation, health care providers, a case manager, organizations services in your community, local or national organizations, knowledge or strengths that you or someone around you has, skills, websites, books, brochures or training programs.'
  - 'Hopefully you jotted down a list of resources that support you when you looked at your map on the last screen. If you have&rsquo;nt done that yet, go ahead and do it now.'
  - 'When you are ready, enter information about each resource, one at a time. First, you will type the specific name or a short description of the resource. For example, you might type &ldquo;Dr. Smith,&rdquo; &ldquo;www.nameofwebsite.com&rdquo; &ldquo;my patience,&rdquo; or &ldquo;SPED at name of elementary school.&rdquo; Next, you will be asked to describe what kind of resource it is. In the examples just above, you might describe Dr. Smith as a Pediatrician, www.nameofwebsite.com as a website, your patience as a personal strength, and Specific Name elementary school as your childrsquo;s school. You will identify a resource (such as a website, a training session, or an organization) and then you will be asked to provide a bit of information about that resource.  Next, you will be asked to click on each need that the resource helps with from a list that is generated from your own SSM.  A resource can help with one need, or with many needs – check all that apply.  For example, time management skills are the ability to manage one&rsquo;s time is a resource that might help with many of your needs while a specific piece of equipment might only help with a single need that you listed. In the last step, you will be asked to rate how helpful each resource is, and to briefly comment on why the resource supports you or not – what about it is particularly helpful or not. Here we are interested in your personal experience with the resource – so answer for yourself (and not based on what others think about the resource).'
