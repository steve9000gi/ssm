  'Welcome to the System Support Mapping Wizard'
welcome-text.paras:
  - 'A System Support Map (SSM) is a way of visualizing the different kinds of support you might use to work on a complicated challenge. Completing SSMs will support your own thinking about your objectives, needs, and resources.'
  - 'Specifically, SSMs walk individuals or organizations through the process of documenting their own role in a collaboration: how they are operationalizing that role in terms of specific responsibilities or project activities; what they need to succeed in meeting their responsibilities; specific resources they rely on (and an assessment of how supportive they are); and their top three wishes to maximize success in their work. Additionally, SSMs from partners can become the foundation for aligning efforts and setting priorities to collaborate efficiently.'
  - 'Check the sidebar for some examples of initiatives for which completing system support maps might guide Title V Maternal and Child Health work.'
  - 'This wizard will ask you questions and then build the System Support Map for you based on your answers.'
  - 'Thank you for creating a System Support Map.  We hope the process and resulting map is useful.  After completing a map, you will have an opportunity to save and print your map.  We will save your maps in a secure database so that you can access them in the future.  Your maps will also be added to a group of maps that may be aggregated and analyzed together in a research project to learn more about the systems that support Maternal and Child Health in the US and territories.  Your map will be de-identified and will not be linked to you personally in any reports or publications resulting from this study.  Please contact Dr. Kristen Hassmiller Lich at klich@unc.edu if you have any questions about System Support Mapping or about the research project.'

# Step 2
overview-header: 'Overview'
overview-text.paras:
  - 'Here&rsquo;s a quick overview of the process.'
  - 'Notice the rings in the chart below and the labels for each ring. The labels are &ldquo;Role/Identity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Most Important Responsibilities,&rdquo; &ldquo;General Needs for Each Responsibility,&rdquo; &ldquo;Available Resources,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wish List.&rdquo;' 
  - 'You will build your SSM step by step, starting inside the innermost ring and working your way outwards.'
  - 'The wizard is intended to build the SSM for you, but there are some things you can control along the way. You can:'  
  - 'zoom in and out of the map by using your mouse&rsquo;s scroll button' 
  - 'move the whole map around by holding the left mouse button down anywhere on the background and dragging' 
  - 'move shapes around by holding the left mouse button down on the shape you want to move and dragging'  
  - 'If the arrows that the wizard builds overlap, you can move the shapes and the arrows will move too, though it&rsquo;s best to do this step at the very end because the position of shapes changes whenever a new shape is added.'
  - 'Once you start the wizard, you can step away and complete the wizard in parts – just keep this browser window open. When your SSM is complete, you will be able to save the map as a special file, which you can open and view or edit further using our web-based System Support Mapping tool. We&rsquo;ll give you instructions on how to do this at the end. You will also be able to download a picture of your map, which you could easily share with others electronically.'
  - 'As a last step before we begin your map, provide a little more context around the initiative. In the text box below, please briefly describe key partners collaborating with you and the time frame for the work.'
  - 'Hit the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to continue.'

# Step 3
prerequisites-header: 'Prerequisites'
prerequisites-text.paras:
  - 'Before starting to build your SSM, focus on a specific challenge.  This could be a National Performance Measure you are targeting or a challenge you are facing within your organization.'
  - 'Please take a few minutes to develop a clear idea of the challenge you are attempting to map and your role in it.'
  - 'This is important! If you don&rsquo;t have a solid understanding of your role in this challenge, this map-building exercise could be unclear and unhelpful.'
  - 'In the text box below, please briefly describe the challenge you will focus on in this map. Example responses might be: to facilitate integration of care coordination activities supporting children and youth with special health needs across the state, to support the social and emotional wellness of children aged 0-8, or to facilitate the implementation of Bright Futures (or another evidence-based intervention). If it helps, you can simply describe the challenge in terms of the outcome(s) you would like to improve.'
  - 'Hit the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to continue.'
prerequisites-focus-description-prompt: 'In the text below, please briefly describe the challenge you will focus on in this map.'
prerequisites-context-prompt: 'As a last step before we begin your map, provide a little more context around your experiences. In the text box below, please briefly describe your child, including age and any particular healthcare needs, diagnoses, or challenges.'

# Step 4
ring1-header: 'Ring #1: Identifying Your Role'
ring1-intro.paras:
  - 'How would you name your role in the work you are mapping?  Some possible roles are: project manager, care coordinator, service provider, health educator, or state public health leader.'
  - 'If you have multiple roles that you want to explore, pick one. Each map is designed to look at one role and one role only. You can come back and fill out other maps for other roles later.'
ring1-label: 'My role is:'
ring1-afterword.paras:
  - 'When you hit &ldquo;Next,&rdquo; your role will be inserted into the map below for you.'
  - 'Hit the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to continue.'

# Step 5
ring2-header: 'Ring #2: Responsibilities'
ring2-aside:
  'Tip: For some people it makes more sense to describe relevant project activities, objectives or goals instead of responsibilities in this ring. As long as you are describing ways you invest your time related to the challenge you are mapping, the specific label doesn&rsquo;t matter.'
# Note: this must include a <span> with id "wizard_role_text" somewhere.
ring2-text.paras:
  - 'The second ring contains the responsibilities that you have in your role as <code><span id="wizard_role_text">_</span></code>.'
  - 'Identify the four to eight most important responsibilities related to this role and add them here.  Some examples are included in the drop-down list in the response box. You may choose one of those as your response, or type something else in.'
  - 'When you click the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button below, the responsibilities you&rsquo;ve entered will be added to the map below. After that you can add other responsibilities, or click the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to go to the next step.'
  - 'One of my responsibilities is:'

# Step 6
ring3-header: 'Ring #3: Needs'
ring3-aside: 
  'Tip: Needs are the ingredients in a recipe for how you get each responsibility done.'
ring3-text.paras:
  - 'The third ring identifies exactly what is needed to meet each responsibility.' 
  - 'Common needs include time, reimbursement, buy-in from your organization, and information. Please be creative here! The more comprehensive this list is the better. Be sure to consider personal needs, like patience, empathy, and creativity.  You can be very specific, such as &ldquo;I need access to a state car to conduct site visits,&rdquo; or more general, such as &ldquo;I need guidance.&rdquo;'
  - 'You&rsquo;ll be asked about each responsibility in turn, starting with the first one you entered. Again, feel free to choose from the drop-down list, or write in something else. As you add needs, they will be entered into your map below. At first, the positioning will look odd. Please keep going – it will improve as you add needs. And, if you want, you can move things around when your map is completely filled in. If you move things now, they will get moved back every time a new item is added.'
ring3-prompt.paras:
  - 'To fulfill this responsibility, I need:'

# Step 7
pre-ring4-text.paras:
  - 'Here&rsquo;s your map so far.'
  - 'Please gather your thoughts about resources that you have tried in the recent past to support completion of your responsibilities. You will be prompted to enter those in the next screen, and it will help for you to have a list ready.'

# Step 8
ring4-header: 'Ring #4: Resources'
ring4-aside:
  'Tip: Think creatively about resources! If needs are ingredients in a recipe, resources might include things like a favorite cookbook/recipe, particular brands of an ingredient, a store that sells everything you need on your grocery list in one stop, or a friend who makes cooking so much more fun!'
ring4-intro.paras:
  - 'The next ring identifies the resources you use to meet your needs from Ring #3.' 
  - 'Reflect for a moment about the needs you listed. What specific things, organizations, places, or people have you tried (whether or not they have helped you) to get that need met? Resources might include knowledge or strengths you or someone around you has, websites, brochures, training programs, public transportation, services in your community, providers, a case manager, local or national organizations, or books you read to build a skill in yourself.'
  - 'Hopefully you jotted down a list of resources that support you when you looked at your map on the last screen. If you haven’t done that yet, go ahead and do it now.'
  - 'When you are ready, enter information about each resource, one at a time. First, you will type the specific name or a short description of the resource. For example, you might type &ldquo;Dr. Smith,&rdquo; &ldquo;www.name_of_website.com,&rdquo; &ldquo;my patience,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tech Solutionz.&rdquo; Next you will be asked to describe what kind of resource it is. In the examples just above, you might describe Dr. Smith as a Pediatrician, www.name_of_website.com as a website, your patience as a personal strength, and Tech Solutionz as an IT support provider. Next, you will be asked to click on each need that the resource helps with from a list that is generated from your own SSM. A resource can help with one need, or with many needs – check all that apply. For example, time management skills are a resource that might help with many of your needs while a specific piece of equipment might only help with a single need that you listed. In the last step, you will be asked rate how helpful each resource is, and to briefly comment on why the resource supports you or not – what about it is particularly helpful or not. Here we are interested in your personal experience with the resource – so answer for yourself (and not based on what others think about the resource).'
  - 'The lines to resources on Ring #4 will be color-coded to indicate their level of helpfulness.'

A responsibility you don&rsquo;t even know how to begin to tackle? We would like you to describe your three most important wishes for how you could be better supported in your work described in this SSM. These wishes will go outside of the outermost ring. Please enter 3 below.'

What could you do to change your role, responsibilities, resources, and needs for the better? You can add these wishes on the outside of the rings, connecting them with the responsibilities, needs, or resources they would change.'
review-text.paras:
  - 'You are almost there! Let&rsquo;s clean up your map.  Try moving the shapes around so that they are evenly spaced and the lines don&rsquo;t cross as much. Be sure to keep the blue rectangles in the blue &ldquo;Responsibilities&rdquo; ring, the aqua diamonds in the aqua &ldquo;Needs&rdquo; ring, the black ovals in the black &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; ring, and the gold &ldquo;Wish List&rdquo; stars outside the outermost ring.'
