# Step 1 
welcome-header:
  'Welcome to the System Support Map Wizard'
welcome-text.paras:
  - 'A System Support Map (SSM) is a way of visualizing the different kinds of support you might use to work on a complicated challenge.'
  - 'An SSM walks an individual or an organization through the process of documenting their own role in a collaboration. It describes what their role entails in terms of responsibilities, what they need to succeed in meeting their responsibilities, resources they rely on (and assessments of how supportive they are), and three wishes: things they don&rsquo;t have that would make their work easier. Additionally, SSMs from parents and caregivers of children and youth with special health care needs can become the foundation for improving care coordination and for aligning efforts to meet families’ needs more efficiently.'
  - 'Check the sidebar for some examples of system support maps that are relevant to parents and caregivers of children and youth with special health care needs.'
  - 'This wizard will ask you questions and then build the System Support Map for you based on your answers.'
  - 'Hit the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to continue.'
example-systems-header:
  'Examples of caregiver systems supporting a child with special health care needs and/or developmental disabilities mapped using SSM:'
example-systems.list:
  - 'Supporting a child’s day-to-day needs: health care, school coordination, at-home care, socialization, etc.'
  - 'Supporting a child in a specific life course, for example helping them transition to adulthood and associated increased independence' 
  - 'Understanding advocacy and communication needs for a child who lives in a group home' 

# Step 2
overview-header: 'Overview'
overview-text.paras:
  - 'Here&rsquo;s a quick overview of the process.'
  - 'Notice the rings in the chart below and the labels for each ring. The labels are &ldquo;Role/Identity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Most Important Responsibilities,&rdquo; &ldquo;General Needs for Each Responsibility,&rdquo; &ldquo;Available Resources,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wish List.&rdquo;' 
  - 'You will build your SSM step by step, starting inside the innermost ring and working your way outwards.'
  - 'The wizard is intended to build the SSM for you, but there are some things you can control along the way.  You can zoom in and out of the map by using your mouse&rsquo;s scroll button. You can move the whole map around by holding the left mouse button down anywhere on the background and dragging. You can move shapes around by holding the left mouse button down on the shape you want to move and dragging.  If one arrow obscures another, you can move the shapes the arrows are attached to and the arrows will move along with them, although it&rsquo;s best to do this rearranging at the very end, when all the shapes and arrows are in place.'
  - 'Hit the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to continue.'

# Step 3
prerequisites-header: 'Prerequisites'
prerequisites-text.paras:
  - 'Before starting to build your SSM, focus on a specific challenge.  This could be meeting the needs of a family with a child with special health care needs or coordinating care.'
  - 'Please take a few minutes to develop a clear idea of the challenge you are attempting to map and your role in it.'
  - 'This is important! If you don&rsquo;t have a solid understanding of your role in this challenge, this map-building exercise could be unclear and unhelpful.'
  - 'Hit the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to continue.'

# Step 4
ring1-header: 'Ring #1: Identifying Your Role'
ring1-intro.paras:
  - 'What role do you play in the system producing this challenge? Some possible roles are: parent, sibling, grandparent, caregiver, or care coordinator. Feel free to add as much detail as you would like. You can describe the health care needs of your child or any other pertinent information for your role'
  - 'If you have multiple roles that you want to explore, pick one. Each map is for one role, and one role only. You can come back and fill out other maps for other roles later.'
ring1-label: 'My role is:'
ring1-afterword.paras:
  - 'When you hit &ldquo;Next,&rdquo; your role will be inserted into the map below for you.'
  - 'Hit the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to continue.'

# Step 5
ring2-header: 'Ring #2: Responsibilities'
ring2-aside:
  'Tip: For some people it makes more sense to describe objectives or goals instead of responsibilities in this ring.'
# Note: this must include a <span> with id "wizard_role_text" somewhere.
ring2-text.paras:
  - 'The second ring contains the responsibilities that you have in your role as <code><span id="wizard_role_text">_</span></code>.'
  - 'Identify the four to eight most important responsibilities related to this role and add them here.  For example, you might have a responsibility to schedule appointments for a child with various health care providers. Or you might have a responsibility to keep a child with limited mobility clean and active. Or you might have a goal to improve a child&rsquo;s socialization with peers.'
  - 'When you click the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button below, the responsibilities you&rsquo;ve entered will be added to the map below. After that you can add other responsibilities, or click the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to go to the next step.'
  - 'One of my responsibilities is:'

# Step 6
ring3-header: 'Ring #3: Needs'
ring3-text.paras:
  - 'The third ring identifies exactly what is needed to meet each responsibility.' 
  - 'Common needs include time, money, and information. Please be creative here! The more comprehensive this list is the better. Be sure to consider personal needs, like patience, empathy, energy, and creativity.  You can be very specific, such as &ldquo;I need access to reliable transportation to attend doctor appointments,&rdquo; or more general, such as &ldquo;I need guidance.&rdquo;'
  - 'You&rsquo;ll be asked about each responsibility in turn, starting with the first one you entered.'
ring3-prompt.paras:
  - 'To fulfill this responsibility, I need:'

# Step 7

  - 'Please gather your thoughts about resources that you have tried in the recent past.'

# Step 8
ring4-header: 'Ring #4: Resources'
ring4-aside:
  'Tip: If needs were ingredients in a recipe, resources might include things like particular brands of an ingredient, or a store that sells many ingredients on your list.'
ring4-intro.paras:
  - 'The next ring identifies the resources that you use to meet your needs from Ring #3.' 
  - 'Reflect for a moment about the needs you listed. What specific things, organizations, places, or people have you tried (whether or not they have helped you) to get that need met? Resources for your map might include public transportation, health care providers, a case manager, organizations in your community, skills, websites, books, brochures or training programs.'
  - 'You will identify a resource (such as a website, a training session, or an organization) and then you will be asked to provide a bit of information about that resource.  Next, you will be asked to click on each need that the resource helps with.  A resource can help with one need, or with many needs.  For example, the ability to manage one&rsquo;s time is a resource that might help with many of your needs while a specific piece of equipment might only help with a single need that you listed.'
  - 'The arrow to each resource in Ring #4 will be color-coded to indicate that resource&rsquo;s level of helpfulness.'
ring4-resource-type-prompt:
  'What type of resource would you like to describe?'
ring4-resource-name-prompt:
  'Can you name/describe the resource more specifically?'
ring4-resource-label-field-before-prompt: 'Use the'
ring4-resource-label-field-after-prompt: 'for the label in the map below.'
ring4-resource-needs-prompt:
  'Please select all the needs that this resource supports.'
ring4-resource-helpfulness-prompt:
  'How helpful has this resource been?'
ring4-resource-helpfulness-description-prompt:
  'Can you describe why you feel the resource is or is not helpful? In what ways?'

# Resource interstitial

  - 'Here&rsquo;s your map so far.'
  - 'If you&rsquo;d like to add another resource, click the &ldquo;Add Resource&rdquo; button. Otherwise, click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;.'

# Step 9
pre-ring5-text.paras:
  - 'Please reflect on your map and consider your wishes. If you could have anything, what might better support you in meeting your responsibilities?'
  - 'The next steps will guide you through entering your top 3 wishes, one at a time.'

# Step 10
ring5-header: 'Outer area: Wishes'
# Note: this must contain a span of class "wish-number":
ring5-intro.paras:
  - 'If you could have anything to support you in your responsibilities, what would it be? These wishes will go outside of the outermost ring. We&rsquo;ll do 3 wishes. You&rsquo;re currently on wish <span class="wish-number"></span> of 3.'
ring5-wish-name-prompt:
  'Please describe your wish.'
ring5-wish-connection-prompt:
  'Does it connect most importantly to:'

review-aside-header: 'Wondering what to do next?'
review-aside-text.paras:
  - 'Now that you have a clear picture of the challenge and your role in it, many people find it helpful to use the map to think about how they could work on the challenge. What could you do to change your role, responsibilities, resources, and needs for the better? You can add these wishes on the outside of the rings, connecting them with the responsibilities, needs, or resources they would change.'
review-text.paras:
  - 'You are almost there! Let&rsquo;s clean up your map.  Try moving the shapes around so that they are evenly spaced and the lines don&rsquo;t cross as much. Be sure to keep the blue rectangles in the blue responsibilities ring, the aqua diamonds in the aqua needs ring, the black ovals in the black resources ring, and the gold wish stars outside the outermost ring.' 
  - 'Once your map looks good to you, you&rsquo;re finished!' 
  - 'When you click the &ldquo;Finish&rdquo; button, this guide will go away and you can view or print your map.'
