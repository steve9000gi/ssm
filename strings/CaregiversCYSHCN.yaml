  - 'A System Support Map (SSM) is a way of visualizing the different kinds of support you might use to work on a complicated challenge. Completing SSMs will support your own thinking about your objectives, needs, and resources.'
  - 'Specifically, SSMs walk responding individuals or organizations through the process of documenting their own role in a collaboration: how they are operationalizing that role in terms of specific responsibilities;  It describes what their role entails in terms of responsibilities, what they need to succeed in meeting their responsibilities; specific, resources they rely on (and assessments of how supportive they are);, and their top three wishes to maximize success in their work.: things they don&rsquo;t have that would make their work easier. Additionally, SSMs from parents and caregivers of children and youth with special health care needs can become the foundation for improving care coordination and for aligning efforts to meet families&rsquo;’ needs more efficiently.'
  - 'Check the sidebar for some examples of challenges for which completing system support maps might guide that are relevant to parents and caregivers of children and youth with special health care needs.'
  - 'This wizard will ask you questions and then build the System Support Map for you based on your answers.'
map-uses-1-span: 'Thank you for creating a System Support Map.  We hope the process and resulting map is useful.  After completing a map, you will have an opportunity to save and print your map.  We will save your maps in a secure database so that you can access them in the future.  Your maps will also be added to a group of maps that may be aggregated and analyzed together in a research project to learn more about the systems that support Maternal and Child Health in the US and territories.  Your map will be de-identified and will not be linked to you personally in any reports or publications resulting from this study.  Please contact '

  - 'You will build your SSM step by step, starting inside the innermost ring and working your way outwards.'
  - 'The wizard is intended to build the SSM for you, but there are some things you can control along the way. You can:'
overview-list-item-1: 'zoom in and out of the map by clicking on it and using the scroll button on your mouse'
overview-list-item-2: 'move the whole map around by holding the left mouse button down anywhere on the background and dragging'
overview-list-item-3: 'move shapes around by holding the left mouse button down on the shape you want to move and dragging'
overview-list-item-4: 'move the shapes (if arrows overlap) and the arrows will move too, although it would be best to do this step at the very end because the shapes are automatically repositioned each time a new one is added.'
overview-text-2.paras:
  - 'Once you start the wizard, you can step away from a partially completed map and finish it later &mdash; just keep the wizard open in the browser. When your SSM is complete, you will be able to save the map as a special file, which you can open and view or edit further using our web-based System Support Mapping tool. We&rsquo;ll give you instructions on how to do this at the end. You will also be able to download a picture of your map, which you could easily share with others electronically.'

Be sure to consider personal needs, like patience, empathy, energy, and creativity.  You can be very specific, such as &ldquo;I need access to reliable transportation to attend doctor appointments,&rdquo; or more general, such as &ldquo;I need guidance.&rdquo;'
  - 'You&rsquo;ll be asked about each responsibility in turn, starting with the first one you entered. Again, feel free to choose from the drop-down list, or write in something else. As you add needs, they will be entered into your SSM. At first, the positioning will look odd. Please keep going – it will improve as you add more needs. And, if you want, you can move things around when your map is completely filled in. If you move things now, they will get moved back every time a new item is added.'

  - 'Reflect for a moment about the needs you listed. What specific things, organizations, places, personal strengths, or people have you tried (whether or not they have helped you) to get your needs that need met? Resources for your map might include public transportation, health care providers, a case manager, organizations services in your community, local or national organizations, knowledge or strengths that you or someone around you has, skills, websites, books, brochures or training programs.'

  - 'When you are ready, enter information about each resource, one at a time. First, you will type the specific name or a short description of the resource. For example, you might type &ldquo;Dr. Smith,&rdquo; &ldquo;www.nameofwebsite.com&rdquo; &ldquo;my patience,&rdquo; or &ldquo;SPED at name of elementary school.&rdquo; Next, you will be asked to describe what kind of resource it is. In the examples just above, you might describe Dr. Smith as a Pediatrician, www.nameofwebsite.com as a website, your patience as a personal strength, and the specific name of an elementary school as your child&rsquo;s school. You will identify a resource (such as a website, a training session, or an organization) and then you will be asked to provide a bit of information about that resource.  Next, you will be asked to click on each need that the resource helps with from a list that is generated from your own SSM.  A resource can help with one need, or with many needs – check all that apply.  For example, time management skills are the ability to manage one&rsquo;s time is a resource that might help with many of your needs while a specific piece of equipment might only help with a single need that you listed. In the last step, you will be asked to rate how helpful each resource is, and to briefly comment on why the resource supports you or not – what about it is particularly helpful or not. Here we are interested in your personal experience with the resource – so answer for yourself (and not based on what others think about the resource).'
