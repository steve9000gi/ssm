The backend is currently (as of 2015-08-25) being hosted on
syssci.edc.renci.org in the /srv/www/ssm directory.

Say you make some changes to the backend. How do you deploy them?

First, you should probaby merge whatever changes you want to deploy into the
master branch, if you haven't already.

Then, bump the version number in project.clj and commit the new version number.

Then, create an uberjar:

    lein do clean, uberjar

The newly created uberjar should be ready at
`target/backend-<VERSION>-standalone.jar`. Copy this file to syssci.

Once it's copied to syssci in the /srv/www/ssm directory, ssh into syssci. The
rest of these instructions will be from within the ssh session.

Change directory to /srv/www/ssm. Then point the
`backend-current-standalone.jar` link to the new jar that you just uploaded:

    ln -sf backend-<VERSION>-standalone.jar backend-current-standalone.jar

Finally, restart the `ssm-backend` service:

    sudo initctl stop ssm-backend
    sudo initctl start ssm-backend

Note that, for whatever reason, the `restart` command to `initctl` doesn't seem
to actually stop the process, which needs to happen to use the new uberjar.

If all's well, there should now be a new `java` process running. You can
determine this by saying:

    ps auxwww | grep -v grep | grep java

The `START` column should be ~ the current time, and the `TIME` column should
be ~ 0.
