Here's what's left to do, as of Sun Aug 9 2015:

- deployment
  - production uberjar
  - deploy somewheres...
- frontend
  - add save/load buttons (maybe replace current functionality?)
  - upon click of either, test authentication
  - if unauth'd, prompt (maybe in modal lightbox) for creds
  - try authenticating, if fail, re-prompt
  - display list of documents to user, with links to load each
  - new user registration
