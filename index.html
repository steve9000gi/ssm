        <h1>Welcome to the System Support Map (SSM) wizard</h1>
        <p>A System Support Map (SSM) is a way of visualizing the different kinds of support you might use to work on a complicated challenge.</p>
        <p>For example, a map for a mother of a child with special healthcare needs would include her responsibilities to her child, what she needs to do to fulfill those responsibilities, and the resources that help her meet those needs. Check the sidebar for some more examples of systems mapped by others.</p>
        <p>This wizard will ask you questions and then build the System Support Map for you based on your answers.</p>
        <p>Hit the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to continue.</p>

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s a quick overview of the process.</p>
        <p>Notice the rings in the chart below and the labels for each ring.</p>
        <p>You will build your SSM step-by-step, starting inside the innermost ring and working your way outwards.</p>
        <p>The controls in the lower left corner may be used to build a System Support Map directly, but this wizard is intended to do the building for you.</p>
        <p>Hit the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to continue.</p>
        <div class="wizard-buttons">
          <button class="back">&laquo; Back</button>

        <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
        <p>Before starting to build your SSM, you should have a clear idea of the challenge you are attempting to map and your role in it.</p>
        <p>This is important! If you don&rsquo;t have a solid understanding of your role in this challenge, this exercise could be unclear and unhelpful.</p>
        <p>Hit the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to continue.</p>
        <div class="wizard-buttons">
          <button class="back">&laquo; Back</button>

        <h1>Ring #1: Identifying Your Role</h1>
        <p>What role do you play in the system producing this challenge? Some possible roles are: patient, family member, teacher, organizational leader, legislator, or community member.</p>
        <p>If you have multiple roles that you want to study, pick one. Each map is for one role, and one role only. You can come back and fill out other maps for other roles later, if you want.</p>
        <label>My role is:
          <input type="text" name="role" />
        </label>
        <p>When you hit &ldquo;Next,&rdquo; your role will be inserted into the chart below for you.</p>
        <p>Hit the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to continue.</p>

        <aside>Tip: For some people it makes more sense to describe objectives or goals instead of responsibilities in the second ring.</aside>
        <h1>Ring #2: Responsibilities</h1>
        <p>The second ring contains the responsibilities that you have in your role as a(n) <code><span id="wizard_role_text">_</span></code>.</p>
        <p>Identify the four to eight most important responsibilities and add them here.</p>
        <p>When you click the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button below, the responsibilities you&rsquo;ve entered will be added to the chart below. After that you can add other responsibilities, or click the &ldquo;Next&rdquo; button to go to the next step.</p>
        <p>I have a responsibility to:</p>

        <h1>Ring #3: Needs</h1>
        <p>The third ring identifies exactly what is needed to meet each responsibility. Common responses include time, money, reimbursement, buy-in from my organization, and information. Please be creative here! The more comprehensive this list is the better. Be sure to consider personal needs, like patience, empathy, energy, and creativity.</p>
        <p>You&rsquo;ll be asked about each responsibility in turn, starting with the first one you entered.</p>

            Tip: If needs were ingredients in a recipe, resources might include things like a favorite recipe, particular brands of an ingredient, or a store that sells many ingredients on your list.
          </aside>
          <h1>Ring #4: Resources</h1>
          <p>The next ring identifies the resources you use to meet your needs from Ring #3. Reflect for a moment about the needs you listed. What specific things, organizations, places, or people have you tried (whether or not they have helped you) to get that need met? Resources for your map might include websites, brochures, training programs, buses, providers, a case manager, organizations in your community, or books you read to build a skill in yourself.</p>
          <p>The lines to resources on Ring #4 will be color-coded to indicate their level of helpfulness.</p>

          <p>Now that you have a clear picture of the challenge and your role in it, many people find it helpful to use the map to think about how they could work on the challenge. What could you do to change your role, responsibilities, resources, and needs for the better? You can add these wishes on the outside of the rings, connecting them with the responsibilities, needs, or resources they would change.</p>
