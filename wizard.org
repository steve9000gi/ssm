** Design questions
*** DONE should a need with the same name be the same node?
CLOSED: [2016-06-09 Thu 20:07]
e.g. time in my example.
I feel like "yes" is the better answer.
But it's harder to position reasonably.
I'm going with no for now. (2016-06-09)
*** DONE should we have different colors for resources depending on helpfulness?
CLOSED: [2016-06-09 Thu 20:11]
I'm gonna say yes, at least as a nice-to-have.
*** DONE should we have different colors or shapes for different types of nodes?
CLOSED: [2016-06-09 Thu 20:12]
Gonna say no for now, though it shouldn't be hard to add later.
*** TODO think about wizard workflow for an already-existent map
One thing in particular bothers me: on steps with multiple nodes added, the
resume feels weird as-is. Like, say we want to edit the text of a node on the
map, but only with the wizard. How do we get to, say, resource #8? Do we have to
click next on the resource step 7 times, or what?
A potentially better way would be to list all the nodes added in a given step.
The problem with that is screen real-estate.
*** TODO when placing a node, should we only move nodes if (all?) others were placed by wizard?
*** TODO what happens to the wizard at smaller screen resolutions?
Should probably at least say overflow: scroll for the wizard.
** Done before hiatus
*** DONE add all steps to DOM, and show/hide them at each step
CLOSED: [2016-04-05 Tue 21:24]
i.e. don't set innerHTML each time.
This will likely clean up event handling, too.
*** DONE highlight wizard-active node in chart
CLOSED: [2016-03-20 Sun 19:41]
*** DONE statically place first role
CLOSED: [2016-02-28 Sun 15:16]
*** DONE statically place first responsibility
CLOSED: [2016-02-28 Sun 22:05]
*** DONE place other responsibilities, moving earlier ones if necessary
CLOSED: [2016-02-28 Sun 23:21]
*** DONE place needs near their responsibility
CLOSED: [2016-03-20 Sun 19:42]
*** DONE depending on the node uniqueness question (see above), might need to position near two or more parents
CLOSED: [2016-06-09 Thu 20:06]
*** DONE reposition previously placed needs to make room for new one
CLOSED: [2016-03-20 Sun 19:43]
*** DONE similarly, position resources
CLOSED: [2016-03-20 Sun 19:43]
** Essentials
*** TODO close button for wizard (on all steps)
*** DONE update text according to Word doc
CLOSED: [2016-06-10 Fri 21:44]
*** DONE functional back button to revise anything
CLOSED: [2016-06-11 Sat 21:26]
*** DONE save wizard-created info on backend
CLOSED: [2016-06-14 Tue 22:38]
This includes whether map was created by the wizard.
Also, which step (and substep) the wizard is currently on, if any.
Should probably auto-save after each substep.
*** TODO when resuming wizard, resume at correct step
Also, ideally, populate form data with whatever is currently in the map.
This might not be possible until the list feature is implemented.
*** DONE populate span#wizard_role_text element
CLOSED: [2016-06-11 Sat 21:35]
*** TODO color resources based on helpfulness
*** TODO deploy (goal: by Fri June 24)
** Nice-to-haves
*** TODO enable wizard for maps with preexisting info
This would require some design to figure out how the wizard works with preexisting info.
Would it move nodes that it didn't place?
Would it refuse to operate on maps that weren't well-formed?
(And if so, how would the error show up in the UI?)
This would also need the wizard added to the options menu.
*** TODO prettify things with better styles
One thing I definitely want is for the back and next buttons to show up at the
same place every time.
*** TODO zoom out map when wizard opened, so that the full circles are shown
*** TODO some things drawn wrong when wizard opened
- This includes captions for nodes.
- Probably includes some other things too--worth testing.
- I also ran into some issue with dragging nodes at the bottom (right) of the
screen. Middle click started dragging, left click finished it. But left drag
didn't work.
*** TODO wizard and toolbox collide if window small enough
See screenshot.
*** TODO edit child nodes of a parent all at once (10 hours)
*** TODO enable swapping out of text (3-5 hours)
*** TODO drop-down completion of common answers at each step
Example markup:
<input type="text" placeholder="enter a fruit" list="dl" />
<datalist id="dl"">
  <option value="apple"></option>
  <option value="banana"></option>
  <option value="strawberry"></option>
  <option value="cherry"></option>
  <option value="pear"></option>
  <option value="kiwi"></option>
</datalist>
* Notes from call with Steve and Kristen, Friday, June 10, 2016
** Wizard only applicable if started with blank state
Don't have to handle preexisting maps, at least for now.
However, be sure to allow users to go away and resume the wizard later.
** Nice-to-have feature for resource placement
For each responsibility R_i:
  - get N_i*, the set of all needs under R_i
  - present multiple text inputs for user for new resources
  - for each text input, retain helpfulness radios
  - also add a select box for which need to associate with
No need to implement this yet.
Before I do, open questions include:
- UI might be overfull, with resource text, helpfulness level, associated need,
  and reason, for each resource under a grandparent responsibility...
** Adding wishes
- For now, add a step for wishes.
- Always give exactly 3 options for wishes.
- For each wish, include a text window and a two-level dropdown for what to
  associate with (e.g. "resource" -> "babysitting").
- Also include an optional text area for why this is here.
** We'll call again Monday to discuss priorities
